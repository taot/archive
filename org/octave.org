#+STARTUP: showall
* GNU Octave
** Basic Syntax
*** Function Definition
functions s = hello_string (to_who)
...
endfunction
*** Comments with # (and %)
File starts with the following line will be treated as an octave script
#! /usr/bin/octave -q
*** Quotes are similiar to c++, C and Perl
*** Unwind-protect (alternative to try-catch block)
unwind_protect
  body
unwind_protect_cleanup
  cleanup
end_unwind_protect
** Built-in ODE and DAE solvers
+ LSODE
+ DASSL
+ DASPK
** Execute an Octave script
octave> run("Script Name with Spaces.m")
$ octave the-script.m arg1 arg2
$ ./the-script arg1 arg2
** Differences between Octave and Matlab
+ Nested functions: Octave does not support nested functions
+ Differences in core syntax
  + Limitations on the use of function handles
  + Limitations of variable argument lists on the LHS of an expression
  + Matlab classdef objeect oriented programming is not yet supported
+ Differences in core functions
+ Just-In-Time compiler: Octave does not have a JIT compiler
+ Compiler: no Octave compiler
+ Graphic handles
+ GUI functions: no Matlab compatible GUI functions yet
+ Simulink: no Simulink support
+ MEX-Files
+ Block comments: #{ and #}, or %{ and %} with some limitations
+ Mat-File format
+ Profiler
+ Toolboxes
+ Short-curcuit & and | operators: In Octave only && and || short cirtuit
+ Solvers for singular, under- and over-determined matrices
+ Octave extensions
** Notes
*** Install package
pkg install "~/downloads/octave-pkg/odepkg-0.8.4.tar.gz"
*** Set decimal display
ocatve> format long e
*** Draw multiple lines in one figure
octave> hold on;
octave> plot(angles, cos(angles), 'g-');
