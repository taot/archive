* TF-IDF
+ IDF: Inverse Document Freqency, \( IDF=log_2 \frac{N}{N_w} \), where N is the number of total documents, with \(N_w\) containing the word
+ TF: Term-Freqency, \( n_w^d \) = frequency of w in document d
+ TF-IDF:
\begin{equation}
TF\mbox{-}IDF = IDF \times TF = n_w^d log_2 \frac{N}{N_w}
\end{equation}
* Mutual Information between F and B (f is feature and b is behavior)
\begin{equation}
  I(F,B)=\sum_{f,b} p(f,b) log \frac{p(f,b)}{p(f)p(b)}
\end{equation}
* Capacity of Communication Channel
Maximum mutual information between sender and receiver per second
